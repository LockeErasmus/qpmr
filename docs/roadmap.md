# Roadmap

## Task to implement
 - quasipolynomial arithmetic operations
 - `QuasiPoly` class with convenient interface and everything
 - `TransferFunction` class with convenient interface and everything
 - tests
 - examples

## Tasks to consider implement

- `qpmr/numba`
- symbolical version of `qpmr`, `qpmr/symbolic` ?
- root multiplicity
- also version for fractional order
- GPU acceleration
- distribution diagram branches for delays
- add aQPmR functionality to find regions free of roots
- QPmR based root-locus

## Simillar python libraries

1. `cxtroots`
1. julia interval arithmetics
